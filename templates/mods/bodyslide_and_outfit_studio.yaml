    BodySlide and Outfit Studio is needed to convert outfits to CBBE and other body types. You need
    to run BodySlide and Outfit Studio when you install a new outfit. This can be a bit complex
    at first. See section "Bodyslide and outfit studio tutorial" in this guide document here:

    Do this once all your clothes/armors and body are installed.
